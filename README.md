## General Information
- This is a full stack e-commerce store powered by the MERN stack and inspired by the official Ufc store website.

- I build this project as a practical application of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, which I learned from  various online learning resources.

- As a Ufc fan, I decided to choose the Ufc theme for this online store to make the journey of building my first full stack web application from scratch more interesting and fun.
